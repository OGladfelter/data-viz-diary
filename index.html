					<p>Today I ran for the 7th consecutive day in a row! Since my running (and fitness in general) was so lackluster in 2021, I’ve decided I want to really focus on running more this year. And what better way to start off by getting a run in every single day for the first week? Normally I run around three or four days in a row before taking a rest day, so going for a whole straight straight felt like a huge accomplishment…</p>
					<p>…that was until I told my friend about it, and he starting going on about his friend who’s been running every single day for the past five years. Apparently there’s an entire website dedicated to tracking “running streaks.” I checked it out, and instantly felt worse about my little 7-day streak. Some of these people have been running straight for years. And yeah, the runners with the biggest streaks are all pretty old - which makes sense logically - but there are plenty of runners who have already have year-long streaks and they’re way younger than I am. Just look at these streakers:</p>

					<p>So now I feel both unaccomplished and old. Great.</p>

							<p class="bottom-space">During lunch a few coworkers and I took this world geography quiz to see how many countries you can fill in on a blank world map. It sounded like fun at first, but then we all compared our scores…</p>

					<p>I'm thinking about writing a book. They say you should write about what you know.</p>

					<p>But seriously, why is it that over time we have fewer and fewer friends, but the number of people who dislike you only grows?</p>
					<p>Like, I don't talk to half of my friends anymore, but I'm pretty sure Billy from elementary school still hates me for stealing his football.</p>

					<p>I went for a run today. I was feeling pretty good about my pace, my distance, all that. Of course, about half way through the run, I bumped into Tom, who was also out for a run. Tom and I run together pretty often, but here’s the thing: he’s way faster and runs far more miles each week than I do. So when we do get together to run, it’s usually basically an easy jog for him and a tough workout for me.</p>
					<p>We crossed paths just north east of the pond:</p>
					<div id="flybyMap" style="height:75vh;"></div>
					<p>When we passed by each other, he looked like he was running twice as fast as I was! I bet he was going longer than I was too. No matter how fast and how far I run, there’s just always someone going faster or going farther…or both!</p>

								<p>Ahhhhh I spent so much of today mindlessly refreshing my email inbox, wandering into the kitchen to see if any snacks had magically appeared since I last checked (nope, the fridge is still empty...), and chasing endorphins by checking my phone (turns out that only works when people actually text you).</p>
								<p>To be fair, I did get some work done...but that was in the like 8 percent of the day I could actually get myself to focus 🤷</p>
								<p>But seriously, do other people struggle to focus as much as I do these days? Is this just the new "work from home" norm, or is everyone else outpacing me with how much work they can get done while I'm busy staring out the window and looking for my laptop charger?</p>
								<p>I imagine most of my coworkers also spend time looking at their phone or taking breaks, but still probably do a better job at budgeting their time...</p>
